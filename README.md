# 📂 C++ Projects Collection

This repository showcases a series of practical, console-based C++ applications developed to reinforce core programming concepts such as control structures, file handling, object-oriented design, and user interaction. Each project is self-contained, well-structured, and designed with clarity and maintainability in mind—making them ideal for learning, demonstration, or portfolio purposes.

## 🧮 1. **Math Quiz Game**  
An interactive arithmetic quiz that generates random math problems (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Users are scored based on correct answers, with immediate feedback to encourage learning through practice.

## ✊ 2. **Stone, Paper, Scissor Game**  
A classic two-player game (human vs. computer) implementing the well-known decision logic of rock-paper-scissors. Features input validation, round tracking, and win/loss statistics.

## 👤 3. **Bank Clients Management**  
A file-based system for managing bank client records. Supports adding, listing, updating, and deleting client information, with data persistence using text files.

## 💳 4. **Bank Management with Transactions Handling** *(Extension of Project 3)*  
Builds upon the clients management system by introducing transaction logging (deposits, withdrawals, transfers). Maintains a detailed history of financial activities per client.

## ▶️ 5. **YouTube Playlists Manager**  
A utility to organize and manage YouTube video playlists. Users can create playlists, add/remove videos, and save/load playlist data to/from files.

## 🏧 6. **ATM System**  
A simulated ATM interface that allows users to log in with credentials, check balances, withdraw/deposit funds, and transfer money between accounts—all backed by secure file-based storage.
